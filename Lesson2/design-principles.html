                <p>I believe that this screen shot exemplifies alignmnet because all the boxes are lined up
                    nicely. The entierity of amazon has these little squares that are all aligned perfectly with one
                    another.
                    Alignment is defined as "arrangement in a straight line, or in correct or appropriate releivtve
                    positions"
                    I believe that Amazon.com displays this perfectly with their many boxes and panels.

                <p>I believe that this screen shot exemplifies contrast because contrast is defined as " the state of being
                    strikingly different from something else." I think that the blue and white create a large contrast and make
                    the website pop in its own way.

                    <p>I believe that this screen shot exemplifies proximity because all proximity is defined as "nearness in space..." I think that
                        the Church of Jesus Christ website has a good amount of proximity between it's different features. 
                        In this screenshot we see the links above a their spacing from the pictures below. It gives us the feeling
                        and knowledge that the two items are seperate but related.
